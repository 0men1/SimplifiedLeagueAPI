This Part of the code is pretty simple. It was just a way for me to talk to the API with having to take many unneccessary forms of thought. 

The components to this part of the code are as follows: 
1. The API.js which is a fild that contains a class called "API" which is used to make an API object that has access to 6 different functions. These 6 functions represent a constructor with 2 variables, 4 functions (2 getters).
2. The Summoner.js which is a file that contains a class called "Summoner" which is used to make a summoned Object that represents a summoner in a game. This could also represent summoners NOT in a game. This class has access to 9 functions. 6 of which are getters, constructor with 6 paramenters, and 2 functions that are used to get the summoner's overall matches, and the match the summoner is currently in.
3. The Game.js which is a file that contains a class called "Game" which is used to make a game object that represents a game in league of legends. This class has access to 7 functions. 1 Constructor with 6 parameters, 5 getters, and 1 functions that used to make a list of summoner objects given a list of participants.





This was PROBABLY unnecessary but I feel like it helps me declutter and keeps me organized when I'm coding. It also helps me keep track of what I'm doing and what I need to do.
